Another thing that I felt is missing, and is a problem at least in some workplaces is lack of communication caused by poor leadership and undefined responsibilities. What I mean by that is when one part of the team, be it design, back-end, or the management, passes the work to the next team, and moves on. Any attempt of communication is halted by the notion that their work is ""done"", rest is up to you. I've been in this situation before, and it feels pretty powerless when you know things aren't going to work out, and there is nothing you can do about it, but you very well know you are going to be the one who's responsible. This might not be the direct aim of this survey, but I feel is hard to neglect."

Since I'm kinda a perfectionist, this is I think a relationship conflict. Also, it depends on personalities and individuals if there will be there more or less conflicts and it is also a problem in psychology.
